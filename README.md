---

Project developed by Sakari Woods, Michael Rettus, Justin Hanson, Keili Rivera and Adam Bullard.

This website displays to users the data that can be readily captured from their web browser. Common uses for the captured data are also explored.

List of data collection methods explored:
* IP address
* Geographic location (latitude and longitude coordinates)
* Device battery level
* Weather based on user's location
* Local census data from user's location
* How many devices are on the user's home network (local port 80 scan)

# Conclusions

* A surprising amount of data can be collected from the web browser alone.
* Many internet users are not aware of what can be collected and what it could be used for.
* User privacy preferences are not always respected by companies.
* Third party cookies can track and follow users throughout the internet.
* Steps can be taken to improve browsing privacy, but they may affect the functionality of a website.
